= Usage

== Installation
  
First, install Sphinx itself. Get the {0.9.8 snapshot}[http://www.sphinxsearch.com/downloads.html], then run <tt>./configure</tt>, <tt>make</tt>, and <tt>sudo make install</tt>. Make sure to set your <tt>./configure</tt> flags: <tt>----prefix</tt> if necessary, and also <tt>----with-pgsql</tt> if you need Postgres support.

You also need the <tt>chronic</tt> gem:
  sudo gem install chronic

Then, install the plugin:
  script/plugin install -x svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/fauna/ultrasphinx/trunk
 
Next, copy the <tt>examples/default.base</tt> file to <tt>RAILS_ROOT/config/ultrasphinx/default.base</tt>. This file sets up the  Sphinx daemon options such as port, host, and index location.
  
If you need per-environment configuration, you can use <tt>RAILS_ROOT/config/ultrasphinx/development.base</tt>, etc. 

Now, in your models, use the <tt>is_indexed</tt> method to configure a model as searchable. For example:
  
  class Post
    is_indexed :fields => ['created_at', 'title', 'body']
  end
  
For more index options, see ActiveRecord::Base .is_indexed.

== Building the index

Now run:

  rake ultrasphinx:configure
  rake ultrasphinx:index
  rake ultrasphinx:daemon:start

To rotate the index, just rerun <tt>rake ultrasphinx:index</tt>. If the search daemon is running, it will have its index rotated live. Otherwise the new index will be installed but the daemon will remain stopped.

== Running queries
    
Query the daemon as so:

  @search = Ultrasphinx::Search.new(:query => @query)
  @search.run
  @search.results
  
For more query options, including excerpt mode, see Ultrasphinx::Search.
  
= Extras  

== Pagination

Once the <tt>@search</tt> object has been <tt>run</tt>, it is directly compatible with the <tt>will_paginate</tt> view helper. In your view, just do:
  <%= will_paginate(@search) %>
  
== Spell checking

See Ultrasphinx::Spell.
  
== Available Rake tasks

See RAKE_TASKS[link:files/RAKE_TASKS.html].

== Gotchas

Since Ultrasphinx pre-loads indexed models at its load time, any monkey-patches or plugins loaded after Ultrasphinx that your models depend on will raise LoadErrors. You may have to pluginize your monkey-patches to get them to work.

== Deployment notes

See DEPLOYMENT_NOTES[link:files/DEPLOYMENT_NOTES.html].

== A note about PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL 8.2 and higher are well supported. However, make sure you have executed <tt>CREATE LANGUAGE plpgsql;</tt> at least once. This step does not need to be repeated, so depending on your DB permissions, you might be able to put it in a migration.
